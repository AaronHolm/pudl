Notes on marginal cost of electricity (MCOE) calculations using EIA860 and EIA923 data
Years in analysis: 2011-2016
Since 2016 data is availble for EIA923 but not EIA860 we have used the 2015 capacities listed in EIA860 to calculate the 2016 capacity factors
Plants with nameplate_capacity < 10 MW are excluded
Heat_rate_mmbtu_mwh < 5.0 are excluded (replaced with NA)
Capacity_factor < 0 are excluded
Capacity_factor >= 1.5 are excluded
Net_generation_mwh < 0 are retained to account for generators where parasitic load is greater than annual net generation
Proportion_generation_by_generator < 0  are retained to account for generators where parasitic load is greater than annual net generation
