plant_id,EIA Plant Identification number. One to five digit numeric.
plant_name,EIA Plant name
operator_name,Name of entity which operates the plant; from EIA923 records
state,US state in which the plant is located
report_date,Data year
generator_id,Generator identification code by plant
energy_source,The EIA fuel code associated with the fuel receipt: https://www.eia.gov/electricity/2008forms/aaqs_923.html
fuel_cost_per_mmbtu_total,(fuel_cost)/(mmbtu); total dollars spent on a given fuel type for a plant in a given year divided by the number of mmbtu in that fuel
fuel_consumed_mmbtu_per_generator,proportion_generation_by_generator * fuel_consumed_mmbtu; where fuel_consumed_mmbtu is total heat content of all fuels consumed by the plant
heat_rate_mmbtu_mwh,Overall heat rate for each generator in MMBTU per Mwh of net generation (fuel_consumed_mmbtu_per_generator / net_generation_mwh_per_generator)
plant_assn,True (value = 1) if all generators are mapped to a boiler for a given year of plant data; False (value = 0) if generator data exists that is not mapped to a boiler in the boiler generator association table in EIA860
net_generation_mwh,Net electricity generation in Mwh for all units that are part of the plant.
fuel_cost_per_mwh,(fuel_cost_per_mmbtu_total)/(heat_rate_mmbtu_mwh); this is plant-averaged fuel costs by fuel type for a given year divided by generator-specific heat rate (mmbtu/mwh)
nameplate_capacity_mw,Total installed capacity for all units (coal or otherwise) that are part of the plant.
summer_capacity,The net summer capacity
winter_capacity,The net winter capacity
capacity_factor,(net_generation_mwh) / (nameplate_capacity_mw * 8760)
