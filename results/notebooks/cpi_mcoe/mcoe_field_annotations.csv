plant_id,EIA Plant Identification number. One to five digit numeric.
report_date,Data year
generator_id,Generator identification code by plant
energy_source,The EIA fuel code associated with the fuel receipt: https://www.eia.gov/electricity/2008forms/aaqs_923.html
proportion_generation_by_generator,net_generation_mwh_per_generator/net_generation_mwh
fuel_cost_by_generator,fuel_cost * proportion_generation_by_generator; where fuel_cost = (fuel_quantity * average_heat_content  * fuel_cost_per_mmbtu) where: average_heat_content is mmbtu per unit of fuel_quantity & fuel_cost_per_mmbtu is all costs incurred in purchase & delivery of the fuel to the plant in dollars per million Btu(MMBtu)
fuel_cost_per_mwh,fuel_cost / net_generation_mwh (calculated by plant and fuel type so values are same for generators with same fuel type)
fuel_consumed_mmbtu_per_generator,proportion_generation_by_generator * fuel_consumed_mmbtu; where fuel_consumed_mmbtu is total heat content of all fuels consumed by the plant
heat_rate_mmbtu_mwh,Overall heat rate for each generator in MMBTU per Mwh of net generation (fuel_consumed_mmbtu_per_generator / net_generation_mwh_per_generator)
plant_assn,True (value = 1) if all generators are mapped to a boiler for a given year of plant data; False (value = 0) if generator data exists that is not mapped to a boiler in the boiler generator association table in EIA860
net_generation_mwh,Net electricity generation in Mwh for all units that are part of the plant.
nameplate_capacity_mw,Total installed capacity for all units (coal or otherwise) that are part of the plant.
summer_capacity,The net summer capacity
winter_capacity,The net winter capacity
capacity_factor,(net_generation_mwh) / (nameplate_capacity_mw * 8760)
real_fuel_cost,fuel_cost_per_mwh * net_generation_mwh
