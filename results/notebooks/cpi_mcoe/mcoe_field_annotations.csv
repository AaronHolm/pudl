plant_id,EIA Plant Identification number. One to five digit numeric.
report_date,Data year
generator_id,Generator identification code by plant
energy_source,The EIA fuel code associated with the fuel receipt
fuel_cost ,"(fuel_quantity * average_heat_content  * fuel_cost_per_mmbtu), where: average_heat_content is mmbtu per unit of fuel_quantity, and fuel_cost_per_mmbtu is all costs incurred in the purchase and delivery of the fuel to the plant in dollars per million Btu(MMBtu)"
fuel_cost_per_mwh,fuel_cost / net_generation_mwh
fuel_consumed_mmbtu,Total heat content of all fuels consumed by the plant.
heat_rate_mmbtu_mwh,Overall heat rate for the plant in MMBTU per Mwh of net generation (fuel_consumed_mmbtu / net_generation_mwh).
net_generation_mwh,Net electricity generation in Mwh for all units that are part of the plant.
nameplate_capacity_mw,Total installed capacity for all units (coal or otherwise) that are part of the plant.
summer_capacity,The net summer capacity
winter_capacity,The net winter capacity
capacity_factor,(net_generation_mwh) / (nameplate_capacity_mw * 8760)
real_fuel_cost,fuel_cost_per_mwh * net_generation_mwh
