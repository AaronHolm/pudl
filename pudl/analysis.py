    Generate a list of FERC plants for matching with EIA plants.

    There are several kinds of FERC plants, with different information stored
    in different FERC database tables. FERC doesn't provide any kind of
    plant_id like EIA, so the unique identifier that we're using is a
    combination of the respondent_id (the utility) and plant_name.

    For each table in the FERC DB that contains per-plant information, we'll
    grab the respondent_id and plant_name, and join that with respondent_name
    so that the utility is more readily identifiable.  We'll also add a column
    indicating what table the plant came from, and return a DataFrame with
    those four columns in it, for use in the matching. That matching currently
    happens in an Excel spreadsheet, so you will likely want to output the
    resulting DataFrame as a CSV or XLSX file.

    The function can generate an exhaustive list of plants, or it can only grab
    plants from a particular range of years. It can also optionally grab only
    new plants i.e. those which do not appear in the existing PUDL database.
    This is useful for finding new plants when a new year of FERC data comes
    out.

    Args:
        f1_tables (list): A list of tables in the FERC Form 1 DB whose plants
            you want to get information about.  Can include any of: f1_steam,
            f1_gnrt_plant, f1_hydro, and f1_pumped_storage.
        years (list): The set of years for which you wish to obtain plant by
            plant information.
        new (boolean): If True (the default) then return only those plants
            which appear in the years of FERC data being specified by years,
            and NOT also in the currently initialized PUDL DB.
        min_capacity (float): The smallest size plant, in MW, that should be
            included in the output. This avoids most of the plants being tiny.
