This Public Utility Data Liberation (PUDL) project is a collection of tools
that allow programmatic access to and manipulation of many public data sets
related to electric utilities in the United States. These data sets are
often collected by state and federal agencies, but are publicized in ways
that are not well standardized, or intended for interoperability. PUDL
seeks to allow more transparent and useful access to this important public
data, with the goal of enabling small companies, non-profit organizations,
and public policy advocates to better understand the electricity system
and its impacts on climate.
