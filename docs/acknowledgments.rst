==================

Support for the PUDL project has come from many different sources.

Open Source Contributions
--------------------------

A lot of the work that has gone into PUDl has been volunteer open source
contributions, both from the members of Catalyst Cooperative and from other
users, especially graduate students and post-docs including:

* Karl Dunkle Werner (EPA CEMS)
* Greg Schivley (EPA IPM)
