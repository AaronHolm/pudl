To run that script at the command line, use `cd` to navigate to the `scripts` directory and call `python init_pudl.py`. You should see some output from the script, telling you about its progress.\n",

The whole process will likely take about 20 minutes, and the database will take up about 2GB of space once it's done. If you want to just do a small subset of the data to test whether the setup is working, check out the help message on the script by calling `python init_pudl.py -h`.\n",

Python has a list of directories that it looks in by default, but our little project isn't in that list, because we're not yet ready to package it up for installation on a user's system.  So we need to tell Python exactly where to find it it. This is what `sys.path.append()` does in the code cell below. Right now this tells Python to look three directories above the current directory (`../../../` for the main PUDL module directory, which is what you got when you cloned our `git` repository. If you're running a notebook from a different directory, you'll need to change that path.\n",
