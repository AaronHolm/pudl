- When f1_fuel into the postgres database for the first time, discovered that
  respondent_id=454 exists in the f1_fuel table, but doesn't exist in the
  f1_respondent_id table.  This violates the ForeignKeyConstraint that we have
  implemented... and means we don't know what utility corresponds to 
  respondent_id=454.  Based on the plants listed in f1_fuel, it appears to be
  an Entergy company.
